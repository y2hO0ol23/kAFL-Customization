Grimoire is coverage-guided fuzzer for structured input languages. It is built upon Redqueen. 

 The fuzzer is based on our [paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-blazytko.pdf):

# Code

Grimoire can be understood as a patch applied to Redqueen's code base.  The
published source code contains Redqueen's fuzzing logic, the implementation of
Grimoire as well as its interaction with Redqueen.

In detail, Grimoire's is organized as follows:

## Inference Logic

The inference logic (paper section 3.1) is contained in
`fuzzer/technique/grimoire_inference.py`.

## Mutations

Grimoire's large-scale mutations (paper section 3.2)  are contained in
`fuzzer/technique/grimoire_mutations.py`.

## Interaction with Redqueen

`fuzzer/scheduler.py` defines `GrimoireScheduler`, which is used in Redqueen's
`InputQueue` in file `fuzzer/queue.py`. Everytime a `SlaveProcess`
(`fuzzer/process/slave.py`) requests a new input from the queue,
a non-generalized input that triggered new coverage will be returned.

This input is then generalized in the state `grimoire_inference` in
`FuzzingStateLogic` (`fuzzer/state_logic.py`)

In a later fuzzing stage---during Redqueen's havoc mutation phase---Grimoire's
mutations will be applied in `FuzzingStateLogic`.
